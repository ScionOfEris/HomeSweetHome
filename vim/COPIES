# Notes for my vim directory.

Many things would probably be better to set up with symlinks.  I may do that yet...
but it would require scripts to deal with.  A git repo can't have symlinks in it, so
for now, we'll cheat, but I'll document any copy that should be a symlink here.


Commands from bleahblah/vim

# cp -r Git_Repos/vim-pathogen/autoload autoload
# cp -r Git_Repos/syntastic/ bundle/
# cp ftplugin/gnupg.vim ftplugin/asc.vim
